The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS2 based example for
NXP 'S32K144 microcontroller using NXP 'S32K144_EVB' Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           80.00 MHz

 - 3 LEDs (RGB LED) are blinking with speed depending on potentiometer.
 - blinking is paused while holding down the SW2 or SW3 button.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  S32K144 RAM:       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULink2
                     runs from Internal RAM located on chip

  S32K144 Flash:     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULink2
                     runs from Internal Flash located on chip
